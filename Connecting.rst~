.. _Connecting-via-SSH:

Connecting via SSH
==================


All the connections to the cluster are based on a secure protocol that
requires authentication. One of the most powerful ways to use the
cluster is via the UNIX command line. Depending on the operating
system that your computer is running, you have several choices for
which command line application to use when connecting with the
cluster.


.. _SSH-clients-for-Linux:

SSH clients for Linux
---------------------

If you are connecting from a Linux box, you can use the standard
SSH-client generally installed with the OS and available via any
terminal application.  Open a terminal window and type the 
following: :: 

 ssh login_id@hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu

where ``login_id`` is replaced by your cluster user name.

.. _SSH-clients-for-Mac:

SSH clients for Mac
-------------------

MacOS, the operating system running on a Mac computer, is just another
flavor of UNIX, as such it comes equipped with a fully functional
Termainal application and an SSH-client. The Terminal application can
be located via Spotlight Search or Finder. Once you have opened a
Terminal window, type the following: ::

 ssh login_id@hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu

where ``login_id`` is replaced by your cluster user name.

.. _SSH-clients-for-Windows:

SSH clients for Windows
-----------------------


Install **one** of any of the following free ssh client programs, which offer a terminal emulator for windows users. The following list, which is not exhaustive and you may opt for a different solution, is ordered from our most to least recommended applications.

.. Note:: Only one of the following software is needed to connect to the cluster via SSH.

- `MobaXterm <http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/>`_ an SSH client that includes an X11 server (for running GUI applications).
- `GitBash <https://gitforwindows.org/>`_ an emulation shell provided by `Git for Windows
  <https://gitforwindows.org/>`_
- `Putty <https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/>`_ an open source SSH and telnet client. 
- `Cygwin <http://www.cygwin.com/>`_ a collection of tools that provide Linux functionalities in Windows systems. 

.. Note::  MobaXterm will also supply the ability to open GUI application (see: :ref:`Opening-GUI-applications`).



.. Todo:: Place here a short discussion on how to configure MobaXterm and Putty... For more information see: `How to configure Putty <http://www.hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu/access/putty/>`_


.. _Opening-GUI-applications:

Opening GUI applications
========================

Some interactive applications require the ability to open a graphical
user interface (GUI) window (e.g., Matlab Desktop, Mathematica
Notebooks, etc.). Anytime you may need to open applications that are
not solely text-based, you will need to connect to the cluster and
allow X11-Forwarding. X11-Forwarding enables users to start a
graphical application remotely and forward the display to your local
computer.

This section, and the :ref:`Connecting-via-NX-clients` section, cover
cases in which no direct rendering is required (and software rendering
is performed instead). The
:ref:`Setting-up-remote-rendering-on_Hoffman2` section covers
instances when applications need to perform direct rendering on
Hoffman2 and display the results on your local computer.
